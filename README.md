# Azure Managed Disk to Unmanaged Disk Conversion.
This script helps you convert an Azure managed disk to unmanaged disk (stored on an Azure storage account).
This script can be useful if you want to migrate an Azure VM across different Azure AD tenant since there is no direct way to migrate VMs between different Azure AD tenants.
